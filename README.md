# Data Journalism Final Project
## By Sofia Schnurer

## **Summary of Work**

This is a project meant to assess movies and tv shows on Netflix's top 10 list. This public data was created through Kaggle and taken directly from Netflix's Top 10 list. Popular movies are based of the amount of hours watched by viewers in the first 28 days. What is important about this dataset is how we can compare genres of popular movies and tv shows on the streaming site. We also have the ability to mark the differences and similarities between popular english and non-english films/tv shows. This dataset can give us a glimpse into current pop culture and the trends that drive the popularity of certain movies and tv shows.

## Questions and Process
1. Which genre is the most popular among English films and which genre is most popular among Non-English films?

Genres among english films:
![english films genre](https://github.com/sofia-sch24/Data-Journalism-Final-Project/blob/5539ad8aa98a4f0722b3999819bf21a16abc4c22/fav%20genre%20among%20english%20movies.png)

Genres among non-english films: 
![non english films genre](https://github.com/sofia-sch24/Data-Journalism-Final-Project/blob/edd2ab95dc22d2c34f48da5509d1a9f6053ee609/fav%20genre%20among%20non-english%20movies.png)

Because this isn't a very long list, we can count which genres of movies are the most popular. For English films, it seems that drama movies are most popular. For Non-English films, it seems that thrillers are most popular. This isn't much of a difference in terms of popular genres because drama films contain similar cinematic elements to thrillers. 


2. Which genre is most often in the top 10 list?
