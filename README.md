# Data Journalism Final Project
## By Sofia Schnurer

## **Summary of Work**

This is a project meant to assess movies and tv shows on Netflix's top 10 list. This public data was created through Kaggle and taken directly from Netflix's Top 10 list. Popular movies are based of the amount of hours watched by viewers in the first 28 days. What is important about this dataset is how we can compare genres of popular movies and tv shows on the streaming site. We also have the ability to mark the differences and similarities between popular english and non-english films/tv shows. This dataset can give us a glimpse into current pop culture and the trends that drive the popularity of certain movies and tv shows.
